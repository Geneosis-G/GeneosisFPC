[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]I made this mod after a request of The Gold Sword who wanted to be able to play Goat Sim as a FPS :) A comment of AlexDragon on the workshop page of the Resizable Goat mod helped me to figure out how I could make this kind of mod ^^
To sum up, I modified the camera parameters so that the center of rotation is inside the head of the creature you control and I disabled zoom.
